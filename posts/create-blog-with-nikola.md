The first thing I need to do to start making blogs is finding a platform for my blogs. Since my needs are simple, 
I don't want a full fledged CMS like Wordpress or Joomla. A static webpage generator should work fine for my 
purpose. Preferrably it should use a program language I am familiar with, like Python or JS, so I can tinker it 
if I want/need to.

Nikola seems to be the one fits the bill.

## Brief introduction to Nikola

[Nikola](http://getnikola.com) is an open source Statis Site Generator. It generates static web pages from 
multiple input formats (`reStruturedText`, `Markdown`, `Jupyter Notebook`, `HTML`, and have plugins for many 
other formats. The generated static web pages and be hosted anywhere, the platform is batteries included and 
easily extensible. 

## Clone Nikola blog-template

Nikola offers many featues. We are interested in its blog-template today. To create you own blog template, you 
should fork the Nikola blog-template from github: [Nikola blog-template](http://github.com/getnikola/blog-template).
