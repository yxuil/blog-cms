For very long time I don't like the idea of write down my thoughts and share with many people that I don't know in person. It is always wired to me. Whatever I can write down must have been written down by someone somewhere already. I don't think people will be interested in my thoughts. Worse, people who bumps into my posts might think they are radiculous.

Over the years I had experiences, accumulated some tips and tricks. I often found they are not organized, and I forget about them and need to relearn quite frequently. I keep going back to search engines and re-discover articles, tutorials, and of couse, blog posts. So I feel I should create my own repository that I can keep as references when I need to.

It will definitely benefit me personally, it would be enough reason for me to post. And if even one of those posts can help one other people, it would be more than enough reason to put it down.

So here we are. I am planning to use this blog for my own use. And hopefully someday someone will find some of my posts useful.
